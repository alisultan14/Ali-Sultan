The purpose of the project is to investigate different sorting algorithms and
analyze their running time. Sorting algorithms differ from each other in that they may be
more efficient with a certain pattern within the list than for others. This is analyzed in this
project by calculating the running time for sorting for the algorithms - namely Bubble
Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, QuickSort with 1st element as the pivot,
QuickSort with the median element of the first,middle and last element as the pivot,
Quicksort by using a random element as the pivot, Java Library Merge Sort and Java
Library Quicksort. The running time for different numbers of elements, ranging from 0 to
100000, is calculated for the quadratic sorts and elements ranging from 0 to 95000000
are sorted for the rest of them. The results are plotted in a graph to give us a clear
visual conclusion of the advantages and disadvantages of all of these algorithms when
compared against each other.
